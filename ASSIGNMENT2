# Custom 1D GAN for Synthetic Data Generation

A "from-scratch" implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using **NumPy** to model and generate synthetic atmospheric  concentration data. This project bypasses high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch to demonstrate the fundamental mathematics of backpropagation, Adam optimization, and adversarial training.

##  Project Overview

The objective of this project is to train a Generator network to produce synthetic data points that are statistically indistinguishable from a set of transformed  readings.

### Key Features

* **Mathematical Core:** Manual implementation of Forward/Backward passes, Leaky ReLU, and Sigmoid activations.
* **Custom Optimizer:** A ground-up implementation of the **Adam Optimizer** (Adaptive Moment Estimation).
* **Dynamic Transformation:** Data is augmented using a deterministic sine-wave transformation based on a specific seed (Roll Number).
* **Evaluation Suite:** Includes Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, Wasserstein Distance, and Q-Q plots to validate generation quality.

##  Model Architecture

The GAN consists of two competing neural networks:

1. **The Generator ():** Takes a 32-dimensional latent noise vector and attempts to map it to a single value representing a synthetic  reading.
* *Layers:* 


2. **The Discriminator ():** A binary classifier that receives a data point (either from the real dataset or the Generator) and predicts the probability that it is "Real."
* *Layers:* 



##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* SciPy

### Data Preparation

The script expects a CSV file named `data.csv` in the `/content/` directory. The file must contain a column labeled `"no2"`.

### Execution

Simply run the script:

```bash
python gan_model.py

```

##  Outputs & Evaluation

Upon completion, the system generates two files:

* **`gan_results.png`**: A 2x3 dashboard showing data distributions, training loss curves, and a Q-Q plot.
* **`pdf.png`**: A high-resolution comparison of the Probability Density Functions (PDF) of the real vs. generated data.

### Metrics Used

* **KS Statistic:** Measures the maximum distance between the empirical distribution functions.
* **Wasserstein Distance:** Measures the "Earth Mover's" distance between distributions.
* **Q-Q Plot:** Visually assesses if the quantiles of the generated data match the real data (ideal match is a  line).

##  Configuration

You can modify the training behavior by adjusting parameters in the `SimpleGAN.fit()` method:

* `epochs`: Default is 2000.
* `batch_size`: Default is 128.
* `lr` (Learning Rate): Default is 0.0002 for both networks.
