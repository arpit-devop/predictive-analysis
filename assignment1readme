# NO2 Air Quality Analysis 🌍

## What's This About?
We're analyzing air pollution data (specifically NO2 levels) and figuring out its statistical patterns using some neat math tricks.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Get the Data Ready
Started with **418,724 air quality measurements**. Cleaned out the junk (missing values, negatives) and kept only valid NO2 readings.

### Step 2: Add Some Personal Flavor
Every roll number gets its own twist using this transformation:

```
z = x + 0.25 × sin(1.2 × x)
```

Think of it like adding a wave pattern to the data. Makes it more interesting to analyze!

### Step 3: Find the Best-Fit Bell Curve
Used **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** to find the perfect Gaussian curve that matches our transformed data.

The formula we're fitting:
```
p(z) = c × exp(-λ(z - μ)²)
```

## The Results 

| What | Value | What It Means |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **μ** (mean) | 25.85 | Where most NO2 values cluster |
| **σ** (spread) | 35.25 | How much values bounce around |
| **λ** (precision) | 0.001462 | How "tight" the distribution is |
| **c** (constant) | 0.021574 | Makes the math work out to 100% |

**Translation**: NO2 levels average around 25.85 ppb but vary wildly (±35 ppb). That's pretty typical for city air quality—lots of ups and downs!

## What This Tells Us 

- **High variance** = pollution isn't consistent (rush hour vs midnight, industrial areas vs parks)
- **The transformation** helps us see patterns that raw data might hide
- **Gaussian fit** works because pollution results from tons of random factors adding up

## Quick Visual Check

Want to see if this actually works? Plot these:

1. **Before/After histogram** - How transformation changes the data shape
2. **Fitted curve overlay** - Does our bell curve match reality?
3. **Q-Q plot** - Quick normality check

## Running the Code

Super simple:
```python
estimate_pdf_parameters(102353018, '/content/data.csv')
```

That's it. Get your μ, λ, and c instantly.

## Cool Extensions 

- Test other distributions (log-normal might fit better!)
- Analyze time patterns (morning vs evening pollution)
- Predict future NO2 levels
- Compare different cities
